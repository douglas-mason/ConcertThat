ConcertThat
===========

Experimental project that manages concert administration and ticket sales

Project named generated by using domain name generator http://impossibility.org/

Uses MVC and Web Api, Automapper, Entity Framework
Choose to use Entity Framework to get refamiliar since I've been using NHibernate for the most part of the last year.

Utilizes a database project to maintain the SQL Server Database to create and maintain updates to the database.
This just feels quicker than using the SQL Server Management Studio interface.  SQL Data Tools are required to use the database project in VS2012.
